#Visualnoveler website
This is the Github repository of Visualnoveler, which will be a website for users to track and discover new visual novels.

This website is still in alpha status and undergoing active development.

###Current development Roadmap

####Recent Development
- Database is populated, it's cleanup time. (About 1500++ Visual novels in the database)
- Added VN route walkthroughs in Fuwanovel to the website, a sample can be seen here
- Added a main library section alongside with the previous library filters. Demo
- Added Google+ and Facebook Authentication so people don't have to fill in forms anymore
- Added filter for visual novels
- Added Translated VN section
- Other less important stuff

####What's next?
- Add Search + Autocomplete
- Add Franchises for VNs
- UI changes to the VN columns
- Mobile responsive VN page

The next major upcoming changes would be the Contest section where people would be able to create a bracket to determine their favourite character/VN (Maybe other stuff) or do a simple poll instead if they find it too complex.
