			<h2>About Visualnoveler </h2>
			<p><b>Visualnoveler</b> is a webapp for fans of visual novels to track and discover visual novels. It's a platform that lets people manage and compare their own visual novel list and also to introduce visual novels to newcomers through bite-sized information. This includes eroge and other type of visual novels but all content in Visualnoveler is safe for work.</p>
			<p>
			You can find reviews and walkthroughs of visual novels in the database. In addition, we are also going to track and catalogue visual novel translation status very soon which is basically doing what VNTLS was doing before they retired. The site forums is now up for users to suggest new features or to suggest edits to the visual novels in the database.
			</p>
			<p>
			As Visualnoveler is still in the early stages of development, we are actively looking for people to help improve Visualnoveler.
